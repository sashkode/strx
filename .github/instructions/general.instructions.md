- Do not run scripts for typecheck or linting. Simply use the available information and context in the editor to make changes.
- When writing strings that include code or file paths, use backticks to enclose the text. This applies to jsdoc, comments, and any other realtime strings.
- Always prefer single line if statements.
- Always prefer arrow functions (except when needing multiple function overloads).
- Always prefer the `Skeleton` component from `@radix-ui/themes` when displaying loading states.
- Always prefer simpler solutions over more complex ones, think about what the framework or library can do for you (don't reinvent the wheel).
